# Hello ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒŽ

Hi, I'm [Carl](https://github.com/stimsonc)! I'm a data scientest who is interested in AI applications in medicine and using NLP for translation and news reporting. 

I recently completed a 12-month intensive data science course at <a href="https://www.bloomtech.com/courses/data-science">Bloom Institute of Technology</a>. I've worked as a Japanese-English translator of scientific research and am now exploring opportunities in machine learning, including but not limited to applications in medicine and NLP. Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-stimson-76ba37166/">LinkedIn</a>.
